# 👋 Hello there!

I am Christoph Hust, ...

🎵 a musicologist ...

📍 based in Leipzig, Germany, and ...

🏛️ working at the University of Music and Theatre.

This is a small collection of experimental code -- partly a sandbox, partly a digital playground. It includes some bits and pieces written out of curiosity, for research, and for teaching. Most of these experiments lead nowhere.

Right now, there are three sections:

---

## 🎼 Music and AI History

A selection of demo code exploring the roots of (algorithmic) music and (proto) AI, originally put together for a presentation in April 2025. Some of it comes from earlier seminars, other bits are very old experiments from a long time ago (and possibly a galaxy far, far away).

---

## 💾 Retro Computing Experiments

A handful of sketches developed during a research project on 1980s home computer music at HMT Leipzig.

---

## 🕹️ Retro Games Experiments

I explored some principles of game design (and, in parallel, of network theory and NLP) by writing some games. They don't really work -- so if you want playable ones: this is not the droid you're looking for.

---

## 🔧 Miscellaneous Tools

Some tools for Digital Humanities / Digital Musicology tasks.

🙂 Thank you for stopping by!
